# 1. ML_Framework : 
  Notebook : **ML_Framework_track_metrics**
  Simple notebook that performs some models exploration

  Implementing simple ML algorithms on a synthetic dataset and keeping track of performances of best score by model obtained by gridSearch.
  Models:
    - Logistic regression
    - Decision tree
    - KNN
    - Sklearn gradient boosting
    - Random forest
    - Grid tuned XGBoost
